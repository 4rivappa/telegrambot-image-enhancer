“only once in your life, i truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. you tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. you share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. when something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. they are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. there is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. you can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. the things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. colours seem brighter and more brilliant. laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. a phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. in their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. you think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. you open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. you find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. you find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”     ―        bob marley

“you should date a girl who reads.date a girl who reads. date a girl who spends her money on books instead of clothes, who has problems with closet space because she has too many books. date a girl who has a list of books she wants to read, who has had a library card since she was twelve.find a girl who reads. you’ll know that she does because she will always have an unread book in her bag. she’s the one lovingly looking over the shelves in the bookstore, the one who quietly cries out when she has found the book she wants. you see that weird chick sniffing the pages of an old book in a secondhand book shop? that’s the reader. they can never resist smelling the pages, especially when they are yellow and worn.she’s the girl reading while waiting in that coffee shop down the street. if you take a peek at her mug, the non-dairy creamer is floating on top because she’s kind of engrossed already. lost in a world of the author’s making. sit down. she might give you a glare, as most girls who read do not like to be interrupted. ask her if she likes the book.buy her another cup of coffee.let her know what you really think of murakami. see if she got through the first chapter of fellowship. understand that if she says she understood james joyce’s ulysses she’s just saying that to sound intelligent. ask her if she loves alice or she would like to be alice.it’s easy to date a girl who reads. give her books for her birthday, for christmas, for anniversaries. give her the gift of words, in poetry and in song. give her neruda, pound, sexton, cummings. let her know that you understand that words are love. understand that she knows the difference between books and reality but by god, she’s going to try to make her life a little like her favorite book. it will never be your fault if she does.she has to give it a shot somehow.lie to her. if she understands syntax, she will understand your need to lie. behind words are other things: motivation, value, nuance, dialogue. it will not be the end of the world.fail her. because a girl who reads knows that failure always leads up to the climax. because girls who read understand that all things must come to end, but that you can always write a sequel. that you can begin again and again and still be the hero. that life is meant to have a villain or two.why be frightened of everything that you are not? girls who read understand that people, like characters, develop. except in the twilight series.if you find a girl who reads, keep her close. when you find her up at 2 am clutching a book to her chest and weeping, make her a cup of tea and hold her. you may lose her for a couple of hours but she will always come back to you. she’ll talk as if the characters in the book are real, because for a while, they always are.you will propose on a hot air balloon. or during a rock concert. or very casually next time she’s sick. over skype.you will smile so hard you will wonder why your heart hasn’t burst and bled out all over your chest yet. you will write the story of your lives, have kids with strange names and even stranger tastes. she will introduce your children to the cat in the hat and aslan, maybe in the same day. you will walk the winters of your old age together and she will recite keats under her breath while you shake the snow off your boots.date a girl who reads because you deserve it. you deserve a girl who can give you the most colorful life imaginable. if you can only give her monotony, and stale hours and half-baked proposals, then you’re better off alone. if you want the world and the worlds beyond it, date a girl who reads.or better yet, date a girl who writes.”     ―        rosemarie urquico
